# Bikesharing
## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge was to prepare visualization data for investors thinking of investing their money into a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.  And to help these investors, we investigated the highly successful NYC Citibike sharing program and the critical aspects of this successful company.  We have prepared visualizations by
  1.	Showing the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  2.	Showing the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and 
  3.	Showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
And to obtain this information and data, we downloaded the 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv file and connected our data with Tableau.  And for Deliverable 1, we used Pandas to change the trip duration to a Date Time format and saved the data frame into a new CSV file.
  
 ## Visualizations 
 
 In August 2019, there was total trip of bikes taken for a ride by riders in the city of NY totaled 2,344,224.  In August 2019, there was total trip of bikes taken for a ride by riders in the city of NY totaled 2,344,224.  And with the data, we realized that there are two kinds of users, the subscribers, and customers, and they are the most significant part of the Citi bike company.

 When we place the cursor over the pie wedges, we can determine that the annual subscribers total 1,900,359. And by using Tableau, we can determine the peak riding hours using the Bar chart.

 Based on the bar chart, we can also determine that the top riding hours are between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm.  Another important data we need to look for to help investor is the top starting locations in NYC.

Also, the male subscribers were higher than the female subscribers in this visual and data.

## Summary
We answered a couple of essential questions regarding the data using Tableau.  What was the number of trips for the month of August? What role did annual subscribers and short-term customers play in the Citi bike share?  This will help us determine the types of customers we could expect from a bike-sharing company in Des Moines. Specifically, you want to determine how the proportion of short-term customers to annual subscribers has changed.  Also, what are the peak hours for bike rentals?  What was the Gender role in using the Citi bikes, and how did it impact the use and sales? 

     1.	We concluded that August was very successful because it’s a warm month, and many people like to ride bikes. 
     2.	Male subscribers were the highest users and followed traditional high-use travel times to and from work.  
     3.	Investors should aim toward male customers to become subscribers since they were higher in the gender category of riders.
     4.	August Peak hours were between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm.  That’s usually when people come out of work.
     5.	Bike repairs should be done between the hours of 2:00 am and 5:00 am
To help investors in Des Moines have a better picture of the Citi bike business in NYC, I collected data from February 2021.  I wanted to show them the data for different months and seasons.

The image above shows the total number of trips that were reported in Feb of 2021.  And we can conclude, that it is much lower than what we saw in August, but still a high number for the month of February.

![Screenshot 2023-01-27 141009](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114379268/215209414-da81f39e-e898-423b-a9e7-d6dd60995d2a.png)

The numbers and totals of the subscribers and customers were also lower, but were still a good considerable number.

![Screenshot 2023-01-27 141428](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114379268/215209743-4ca28107-6624-49b2-81bb-26756269961b.png)

And in the graph above, it looks very similar to the graph of August.  Peak hours were around 4:00 pm. So, we can conclude that no matter what the season is or what month, the peak month will always be the same for the use of the bikes and thats around the evening when people leave work.

I would have liked it if the data included weekend information so we could have a better picture for the investors. I also looked up the population of Des Moines, roughly 214,000.  So, compared with the numbers of NYC, even if they didn’t have many stations, they would have a higher chance of succeeding.
