# Bikesharing
## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge was to prepare visualization data for investors thinking of investing their money into a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.  And to help these investors, we investigated the highly successful NYC Citibike sharing program and the critical aspects of this successful company.  We have prepared visualizations:
  1.	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  2.	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. 
  3.	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
  
  ## Results:
