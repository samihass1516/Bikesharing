# Bikesharing
## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge was to prepare visualization data for investors thinking of investing their money into a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.  And to help these investors, we investigated the highly successful NYC Citibike sharing program and the critical aspects of this successful company.  We have prepared visualizations by
  1.	Showing the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  2.	Showing the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and 
  3.	Showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
And to obtain this information and data, we downloaded the 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv file and connected our data with Tableau.  And for Deliverable 1, we used Pandas to change the trip duration to a Date Time format and saved the data frame into a new CSV file.
  
 ## Visualizations

 When we place the cursor over the pie wedges, we can determine that the annual subscribers total 1,900,359. And by using Tableau, we can determine the peak riding hours using the Bar chart.

 Based on the bar chart, we can also determine that the top riding hours are between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm.  Another important data we need to look for to help investor is the top starting locations in NYC.
